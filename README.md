# ECON 490 Spring 2021 - ML in Econ

This repository contains the materials I created from my course Applied Machine Learning in Economics (UIUC ECON 490 Spring 2021).
The techniques were taught in Python.
The previous Fall 2020 class was taught in R.

**Note:** solutions to assignments are deliberately not included.
Additionally, data used in this class are not provided. However, lecture 7 describes how to construct the data used throughout the lectures, and HW 1 describes how to construct the data used in the homework assignments.
